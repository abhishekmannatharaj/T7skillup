# 📌 Vision

India produces **1.5+ million engineering graduates every year**, yet **only about 45% are employable**.

The reason is not a lack of effort — it is a **Skill-Market Mismatch**.

Traditional learning platforms provide:

❌ Static course lists
❌ No industry verification
❌ No measurable skill readiness

**T7skillup transforms career preparation into an intelligent AI-guided ecosystem.**

Students no longer follow random tutorials — they follow an **Autonomous Career Roadmap aligned with real industry demand.**

---

# 💡 The Problem

### ⚠️ The Semantic Gap

University syllabuses update every **4 years**, but industry technologies evolve every **4 months**.

### ⚠️ Passive Learning Trap

More than **70% of students lose focus on YouTube** because of recommendation rabbit holes.

### ⚠️ Institutional Blindspot

Colleges only realize **skill gaps during placements**, when it is already too late.

---

# 🚀 Our Solution

**T7skillup combines AI career intelligence with learning guardrails to create a guided career system.**

### 🧠 AI Skill Intelligence

Analyzes resumes and compares them with industry job descriptions.

### 🌳 Dynamic Skill Tree

Skills unlock only after mastery verification.

### 🛡 Learning Guardrails

Chrome extension removes distractions and enforces focused learning.

### 📊 Institutional Insights

Colleges receive real-time analytics on student readiness.

### 🏛 Government Scholarship Access

Government agencies can identify high-performing students and **grant scholarships or educational subscriptions based on verified skill achievements.**

---

# ✨ Core Ecosystem Features

---

# 🌐 Command Center (Web Platform)

### 🧠 AI Semantic Skill Audit

Using **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, the system compares:

* Student Resume
* Skill Self Assessment
* Real Industry Job Descriptions

It generates a **Career Readiness Quotient** that reflects how prepared a student is for industry roles.

---

### 🌳 Dynamic Skill Roadmap

Instead of static courses, the AI builds a **skill dependency tree**.

Example:

Python → Data Structures → Machine Learning → Deep Learning

Students must **verify skills through assessments before unlocking advanced topics.**

---

### 📊 Placement Officer / Mentor Dashboard

Placement officers, teachers, and mentors can access an **admin portal** to monitor:

* Student skill progress
* Project accomplishments
* Learning activity
* Career readiness scores
* Department-wide skill gaps

This allows **early intervention before placement season begins.**

---

### 🏛 Government Scholarship Integration

Verified skill achievements allow:

* Government bodies
* Educational foundations
* Scholarship programs

to identify talented students and provide:

* Learning platform subscriptions
* Skill scholarships
* Industry training programs

This creates a **transparent skill-based scholarship ecosystem.**

---
